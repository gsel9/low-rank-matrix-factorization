"""Selecting model rank with LarsMC.

* Algorithm iterates until all variables in acive set or
  n_iter > max_iter. Thus, max_iter < rank impose sparsity.

* LassoLars is subclass of Lars which has argument `n_nonzero_coefs`.
  In LassoLars, `n_nonzero_coefs=max_iter`.

* Weights might blow-up if fitting intercept.
